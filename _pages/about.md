* I am currently a postdoctoral in [Gaoling school of Artificial Intellgence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/index.htm), under the supervision of Prof. [Zhicheng Dou](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/academicfaculty/teachers/20190813022.html)<br>
* I am received a Ph.D. student in the [Institute of Information Engineering](https://iie.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://ucas.ac.cn/), under the supervision of Associate Prof. Xiaofei Zhou and Prof. Jianlong Tan. <br>
* I received my Bachelor's degree in [Hennan University](http://en.henu.edu.cn) in Henan, China.

# Research
My current research interests including Web Mining and Data Mining, particularly in graph representation learning, knowledge graph reasoning, recommendation system and information retrieval.<br>
I also interested in building the effective and scalable algorithms with the deep/reinforencement learning techniques.
