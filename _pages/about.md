* I am currently a lecturer in [School of Artificial Intellgence](https://cist.bnu.edu.cn/xygk/szdw/zj/cf696fc4586d40c5b39c5c634383bc01.html) Beijing Normal University, China. 
* I was a postdoctoral in [Gaoling school of Artificial Intellgence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/index.htm), Renmin University of China, under the supervision of Prof. [Zhicheng Dou](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/academicfaculty/teachers/20190813022.html).<br>
* I have received a Ph.D. student in the [Institute of Information Engineering](https://iie.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://ucas.ac.cn/), under the supervision of Associate Prof. Xiaofei Zhou and Prof. Jianlong Tan. <br>

# Research
My research interests include recommendation system, information retrieval, knowledge graph representation and reasoning, data mining and Foundation Models.
